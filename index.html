			<h2>The Life of Simon - A Short Summaryüåç</h2>
			<p>On the 14th of June 2002 I was born in Stockholm where I lived for 4 years. Then my family decided they had had enough of the city life and we moved 500km south to the small town of √Ñlmhult. This is where I spent most of my childhood. At the age of 14 I moved to Bangalore, India. This was the most crazy experience of my life so far but I grew so much from it! After 4 years there and finishing high school, I took off to France and ESSEC Business School where I'm currently studying. Next semester I'm moving to Singapore, the 4th country I live in.
